# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was built to serve as a study guide for the topics I learned during the pre-work modules. It will act as a reference point for notes as I move forward in the course. During the process of the project I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the individual roles they play in web development. As well as Git & GitHub which provide version control to help make the development process smoother.
