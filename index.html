          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to track web projects inside remote repos.</li>
          <li>Version control - Version control systems allow us to track and manage changes to our codebase.
          </li>
          <li>Branch - workspace where you can make changes; avoiding changes to live site.

          </li>
          <li>Merge - when a  pull request (PR) is approved, changes are merged into the main branch. </li>
          <li>GitHub issues - gives developers and teams an easy way to keep track of key tasks and progress.</li>
          <li>Feature branch - When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch.</li>
          <li>Base branch - where changes (commits) will be merged into; (default branch/main).</li>
          <li>Git clone - Clones a newly created directory.</li>
